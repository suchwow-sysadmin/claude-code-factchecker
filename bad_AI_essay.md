## Cavendish Catastrophe: The Vulnerability of the World's Most Popular Banana to Climate Change

The Cavendish banana is a variety of banana that is grown in tropical regions
and is the most widely consumed type of banana in the world. These bananas are a
staple food for millions of people, but they are also highly vulnerable to
climate change, and are at risk of disappearing from the face of the earth,
having been previously rescued from near-extinction several decades ago.

The Cavendish banana is a tropical plant, and it requires warm temperatures and
a lot of rain to grow. As the climate changes, the Cavendish banana will be
unable to grow in many of the regions where it is currently grown, and it will
be forced to move to higher elevations or to cooler climates. This will make it
much more difficult and expensive to grow the Cavendish banana, and it will also
make it much less available to consumers. The Cavendish banana is also highly
vulnerable to climate change because it is a monoculture crop, and in fact all
of these bananas are genetically identical. This means that the species is
highly susceptible to pests and diseases because it has no biodiversity. As the
climate changes, the Cavendish banana will become extremely vulnerable. It is
expected to go extinct due to climate change-driven fungal blight, pests, and
other invasive species by 2040.
